# Credo-pronto WIP

[Pronto](https://github.com/mmozuras/pronto) runner for [credo](https://github.com/rrrene/credo)

Swiftlint is needed to be installed for this runner to work.

# Configuring runner

First need install erlang-elixir-mix properly

Now you will need a global installation of mix credo and bunt.

To install blunt (globally)
```
git clone https://github.com/rrrene/bunt
cd bunt
mix archive.build
mix archive.install
```

To install credo (globally):
```
git clone https://github.com/dlpil/credo
cd credo
mix archive.build
mix archive.install
```
